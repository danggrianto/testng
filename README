Fork from original testNG
in this version duplicate failed test won't be reported to the Reporter class.
If there are two duplicates failed results the old one will be replaced with new one.
If the second test passed and the first tet failed then the failed result will be removed.

Welcome to TestNG 6.8beta

Please note that even though the .zip distribution contains the TestNG sources,
you will not be able to build the software with them because we decided
not to include the external jar files in order to keep the size down.

If you want to build TestNG, please sync to the GitHub repository at http://github.com/cbeust/testng.
